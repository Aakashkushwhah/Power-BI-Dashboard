 Excited to share my recent project on Power BI Coca-Cola USA for the years 2022 and 2023! 🚀During this project, I utilized a variety of Power BI features to analyze and visualize key performance metrics, including:📊 Pie Charts - To represent the market share distribution across different Regions. 📈 Scatter Column Charts - To highlight the correlation between total sales and profit . 📌 KPIs - To track essential business metrics and monitor progress against targets. 🔍 Slicers - To enable dynamic filtering and provide a user-friendly experience. 📋 Tables - To display detailed all data and summary statistics.A key accomplishment was calculating the average total sales, providing valuable insights into performance trends over these two crucial years.
